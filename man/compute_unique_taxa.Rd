\title{Compute count of unique taxa given hierarchical taxonomy}
\usage{
compute_unique_taxa(selected_taxa, taxonomy_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{selected_taxa}{Character vector of taxon names.}

\item{taxonomy_data}{Data frame with at least columns:
\code{taxon}, \code{Order}, \code{Suborder}, \code{Superfamily},
\code{Family}, \code{Genus}, \code{Species}.}
}
\value{
Integer count of unique taxa.
}
\description{
Given a vector of selected taxon names and a taxonomy data frame, count how
many are "unique" in the sense that parent taxa are not counted when a more
specific descendant is also selected.
}
\details{
A taxon is treated as a parent of another when all of its non-NA rank fields
(e.g. Order, Suborder, Superfamily, Family, Genus, Species) match the
corresponding fields of the other taxon. Parents that are ancestors of any
other selected taxon are not counted as unique.
